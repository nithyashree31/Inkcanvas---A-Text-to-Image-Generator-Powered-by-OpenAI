InkCanvas is a text-to-image converter that empowers users to provide textual descriptions and, in return, receive beautifully rendered images that encapsulate the essence of those descriptions.
Whether you are an artist seeking to quickly sketch out ideas, a writer looking to visualize scenes from your narrative, or a designer prototyping concepts, InkCanvas offers an innovative and efficient solution.
The underlying technology driving InkCanvas is a synergy of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and GAN-based image generation. Users input textual descriptions, which are first processed through an NLP model.
